# üìã Recommendation System Changelog

## October 26, 2025 - Major Improvements

### üéØ Issues Fixed

1. **Not enough CS electives for CS majors**
   - System was only recommending 6-8 CS courses
   - Diversity penalty was limiting major department representation

2. **Courses with unmet prerequisites being recommended**
   - Some 300-level courses shown without 200-level prereqs
   - LLM was too lenient ("fail-open" on errors)
   - No rule-based fallback

---

### ‚úÖ Changes Made

#### 1. Prerequisite Checking - Two-Layer System

**Rule-Based Layer (New)**:
```python
def rule_based_prerequisite_check():
    # Fast pattern matching for common cases:
    - Explicit prereqs in description: "Prerequisite: CS 112"
    - CS 200+ requires CS 111/112
    - CS 300+ requires 200-level courses
    - Math courses require calculus
    - Instructor consent courses blocked
```

**LLM Layer (Enhanced)**:
- Temperature lowered: `None ‚Üí 0.1` (more conservative)
- Default changed: `True ‚Üí False` (block on error)
- Prompt rewritten to be STRICT and CONSERVATIVE
- Added explicit prerequisite rules in prompt

**Error Handling**:
```python
# Before: Allow on error (fail-open)
except Exception:
    return (True, "Check failed")

# After: Block on error (fail-closed)
except Exception:
    if course_num >= 300:
        return (False, "Blocking advanced course to be safe")
    return (False, "Check failed, blocking to be safe")
```

#### 2. Major Course Representation

**Increased Major Bonus**:
```python
# Before
MAJOR_BONUS = 0.15  # 15% boost

# After
MAJOR_BONUS = 0.35  # 35% boost
```

**No Diversity Penalty for Major Courses**:
```python
def compute_department_diversity_score(
    selected_courses,
    candidate_dept,
    is_major_dept=False  # NEW parameter
):
    if is_major_dept:
        return 1.0  # No penalty for major dept
```

**Minimum Major Course Guarantee**:
```python
MIN_MAJOR_COURSES = 12  # Ensure at least 12 major courses

# After MMR re-ranking:
if len(major_courses) < MIN_MAJOR_COURSES:
    # Replace worst non-major with best major courses
    # Until we have 12+ major courses
```

#### 3. Adjusted Weights

```python
# Before
SIMILARITY_WEIGHT = 0.8
HUB_COVERAGE_WEIGHT = 0.2
DIVERSITY_WEIGHT = 0.05
MAJOR_BONUS = 0.15

# After
SIMILARITY_WEIGHT = 0.7   # Balanced
HUB_COVERAGE_WEIGHT = 0.2  # NEW hubs only
DIVERSITY_WEIGHT = 0.05    # Not applied to major
MAJOR_BONUS = 0.35         # Strong boost
MIN_MAJOR_COURSES = 12     # Hard minimum
```

#### 4. Enhanced Logging

**Prerequisite Blocking**:
```
‚Üí Checking prerequisites for 247 courses...
  ‚úó CASCS210: CS 210 typically requires CS 111 or CS 112 [RULE]
  ‚úó CASCS330: Requires CS 112 (data structures) [LLM]
  ‚úó CASMA442: Already completed equivalent MA 242 [RULE]
  ... and 54 more
‚úì Prerequisite check: 189 eligible, 58 blocked
```

**Major Course Stats**:
```
‚úì Returning 20 recommendations:
   - 14 major-related courses
   - 7 departments
   - 3 schools
```

### üìä Impact

#### Before (Problems)
| Issue | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Only 6-8 major courses | CS major gets 6 CS + 14 random |
| Unmet prerequisites | CS 330 without CS 210 |
| Too much diversity | Avoids CS dept after 5 courses |
| Equivalent duplicates | MA 442 when have MA 242 |

#### After (Solutions)
| Solution | Result |
|----------|--------|
| 12+ major courses guaranteed | CS major gets 12-15 CS courses |
| Two-layer prerequisite checks | All courses are eligible |
| No major dept penalty | Can have 15+ CS courses |
| Rule + LLM catches equivalents | No duplicates |

### üß™ Testing

#### Test Script
```bash
# Via Python script
echo '{"userId": YOUR_USER_ID}' | python3 apps/scripts/recommend_courses.py 2>&1

# Via API
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/recommendations?googleId=YOUR_GOOGLE_ID"
```

#### Expected Output
```
Computing recommendations for user X...
  ‚úì User major: Computer Science
  ‚úì Excluding 15 completed + 3 bookmarked
  ‚Üí Checking prerequisites for 247 courses...
  ‚úì Prerequisite check: 189 eligible, 58 blocked
  ‚úì Returning 20 recommendations:
     - 14 major-related courses   ‚Üê Should be 12+
     - 7 departments
     - 3 schools
```

### üîß Files Modified

1. **`apps/scripts/recommend_courses.py`**:
   - Added `rule_based_prerequisite_check()` function
   - Enhanced `check_prerequisites_with_gemini()` with stricter prompt
   - Updated `filter_by_prerequisites()` to use two-layer checking
   - Modified `compute_department_diversity_score()` to skip major dept penalty
   - Added minimum major course guarantee logic
   - Adjusted weights: `MAJOR_BONUS`, `SIMILARITY_WEIGHT`

2. **`requirements.txt`**:
   - Added `google-generativeai>=0.8.0`

3. **Documentation**:
   - `IMPROVED_RECOMMENDATION_SYSTEM.md` (detailed guide)
   - `PREREQUISITE_CHECKING.md` (prerequisite system)
   - `CHANGELOG_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` (this file)

---

### üöÄ Next Steps

#### For the User

1. **Restart backend**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test in your app**:
   - Load the swiper/recommendations page
   - Check console logs for stats
   - Verify you see 12+ major courses
   - Confirm all courses have prerequisites met

3. **Adjust if needed**:
   - Want more major courses? Increase `MIN_MAJOR_COURSES = 15`
   - Want stricter prereqs? Remove LLM layer, keep rules only
   - Want more variety? Decrease `MAJOR_BONUS = 0.25`

#### Monitoring

Watch stderr logs:
```bash
# You should see:
- "‚úì Prerequisite check: X eligible, Y blocked"
- "- X major-related courses" (should be 12+)
- Blocked course details for debugging
```

---

### üí° Configuration Examples

#### Very Strict Prerequisites (Block Almost Everything)
```python
MAJOR_BONUS = 0.35
# Remove LLM layer entirely, keep rules only
# In filter_by_prerequisites(), comment out LLM section
```

#### Maximum Major Courses (15+ CS courses)
```python
MIN_MAJOR_COURSES = 15
MAJOR_BONUS = 0.50  # 50% boost
DIVERSITY_WEIGHT = 0.0  # No diversity at all
```

#### Balanced (Current Settings)
```python
MIN_MAJOR_COURSES = 12
MAJOR_BONUS = 0.35
DIVERSITY_WEIGHT = 0.05
SIMILARITY_WEIGHT = 0.7
```

---

### üêõ Troubleshooting

#### Still seeing courses with unmet prerequisites?

1. Check logs - which layer passed the course?
2. Add debug logging in rule checks
3. Make LLM more strict: temperature = 0.0
4. Add specific rule for that pattern

```python
# Example: Block specific course
if course_code == "CASCS XXX":
    return (False, "Specific rule for XXX")
```

#### Not enough major courses?

1. Check `user_major` is set in database
2. Verify `compute_major_bonus()` detects it
3. Increase `MIN_MAJOR_COURSES` to 15
4. Increase `MAJOR_BONUS` to 0.50

```python
# Debug logging
print(f"User major: {user_major}", file=sys.stderr)
print(f"Major bonus for {course['department']}: {major_bonus}", file=sys.stderr)
```

#### Too many CS courses (want more variety)?

```python
MIN_MAJOR_COURSES = 8   # Lower minimum
DIVERSITY_WEIGHT = 0.15  # Increase diversity
```
