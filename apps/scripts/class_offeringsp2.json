    "description": "Teaches computer programming concepts, core statistical concepts, and related skills via MATLAB. Programming examples that cover four steps of neuroscience research (experiment control; random samples; data analysis; brain process simulation) promote \"constructive\" understanding of the quantitative reasoning behind decisions based on descriptive and inferential statistics (e.g., confidence intervals, linear regression models, model- specific anovas). Explains numerical integration programs in two settings: probability distributions, and simulations of neural dynamics. Effective Fall 2018, this course fulfills a single unit in each of the following BU Hub areas: Quantitative Reasoning I, Critical Thinking.",

Topic for Spring 2025 - Neurogenetics: Students will gain conceptual understanding of the contributions of genes and epigenetics to various behaviors and neuropathologies. The subject will be explored through various approaches such as behavioral genetics research, genetic inheritance and epigenetics, candidate gene approaches, animal studies, and other approaches such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In addition to basic physical behaviors, students will explore psychiatric disorders, and will conduct literature research regarding the genetic basis of behaviors/pathologies of interest.",

    "description": "Teaches computer programming concepts, core statistical concepts, and related skills via MATLAB. Programming examples that cover four steps of neuroscience research (experiment control; random samples; data analysis; brain process simulation) promote \"constructive\" understanding of the quantitative reasoning behind decisions based on descriptive and inferential statistics (e.g., confidence intervals, linear regression models, model-specific anovas). Explains numerical integration programs in two settings: probability distributions, and simulations of neural dynamics. Effective Fall 2018, this course fulfills a single unit in each of the following BU Hub areas: Quantitative Reasoning I, Critical Thinking.",
