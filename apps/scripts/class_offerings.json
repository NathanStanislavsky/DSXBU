    "description": "Undergraduate Prerequisites: two years of high school algebra. - For science majors and minors who require a two-semester general chemistry course, but have little prior experience with chemistry. Topics include: atoms and molecules; quantum theory and atomic structure, chemical periodicity; bonding in diatomic and polyatomic molecules; stoichiometry and introduction to reactions in aqueous solutions; properties of gases; and thermochemistry and the first law of thermodynamics. Laboratory exercises include basic training in lab safety and handling of chemical and experiments complementing the lectures, such as investigations of the size of an atom, gas laws, thermochemistry, and quantum aspects. Students must register for the following three (3) course components: lecture, discussion, and laboratory. Carries natural science divisional credit (with lab) in CAS. Effective Fall 2018, this course fulfills a single unit in each of the following BU Hub areas: Scientific Inquiry I, Quantitative Reasoning I.",

In many cases, it is no longer possible to design feasible algorithms that can freely access the entire data set. Instead of that we often have to resort to techniques that allow for reducing the amount of data such as sampling, sketching, dimensionality reduction, and core sets. Also explores scenarios in which large data sets are distributed across several machines or even geographical locations and the goal is to design efficient communication protocols or MapReduce algorithms. Includes a final project and programming assignments in which we explore the performance of our techniques when applied to publicly available data sets. Effective Fall 2021, this course fulfills a single unit in each of the following BU Hub areas: Quantitative Reasoning II, Creativity/Innovation.",

    "description": "Blockchain technology amalgamates technical tools, economic mechanisms, and system design patterns. It facilitates the construction of information systems with novel combinations of robustness, decentralization, privacy, cost, and flexibility. Beyond their initial use in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, blockchains have become a promising and powerful technology in business, financial services, law, and other areas. This course covers blockchain technology in a comprehensive, systematic, and interdisciplinary way. It surveys major approaches, variants, and applications of blockchains in these areas. Beyond a solid grasp of the principles, the course aims to build familiarity with practice through numerous case studies and hands-on projects. To facilitate its interdisciplinary perspective, this course will be open to two categories of students: students with Computer Science background (graduate or advanced undergraduate), and graduate students with a substantial Business or Law background and a working knowledge of computer programming. Projects will be done in heterogeneous teams combining these categories, and will center on devising and analyzing sample applications of blockchain technology, including both prototype implementations and analysis of its business/legal implications. Topics covered: disentangling 'blockchain'; cryptographic prerequisites; assets and their representations; on-chain programming; state consensus; deployments; decentralized applications (Dapps/Web3); protocol governance; protocol revenue and business models; market structure; privacy and authorization; regulation. Notes for Questrom students: While this course is explicitly designed to accommodate Questrom students, its formal listing this year is as a Computer Science. Thus, to count as an elective towards Questrom graduate degree requirements, you need to submit a Graduate Elective Request.",
